# XP Gained

This is a MUSHclient plugin for the specific [MUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD), SWmud

This plugin was a request by a fellow player to track xp gains over a one hour period.   It calculates and displays in a side window the ammount of xp gained from the most recent event that awarded xp (see Prompts below).  Also, when the timer is turned on (see Alias Commands), it will track the aggregate xp earned for the duration of the one hour timer.
